# Contains the following:
#
# baseName()
# dirName()
# scriptName()
# scriptDir()
# suffix()
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# Avoid double inclusion, but optionally allow a forcing option
# mainly for developers. For example: "source libStdOut -f"
#
[ -v libFilesImported ] && [ "$1" != "-f" ] && return

    # parallel the behavior of "dirname").

    local tmp2=${tmp1%/*}

    # If there was nothing left after removing the last level in the path,
    # the path must be to something in the root directory, so the result
    # should just be the root directory. Otherwise, if there wasn't any last
    # level, the path must be to something in the current dir, so the result
    # should just be the current dir. Otherwise,

# Returns the absolute path to the script itself
#
# Usage for this is primarily at script startup, for those
# occasions when a script needs to know the location
# of the script itself.

# Takes no args. Uses $0 from env

#
# Returns the name of the script with suffix, if any.
#
# Usage for this is primarily at script startup, so that
# a script doesn't need to hard code in its name.

# caller: echo $(scriptFile $0)

    # "/music/../beatles", which results in "./beatles" which 
    # of course is not a suffix. Easier to correct after.

# fileTrimLeft 1 
# parent, ancestor, root, stem, name
# 
#  os.path.split(path)
# 
#     Split the pathname path into a pair, (head, tail) where tail is the
#     last pathname component and head is everything leading up to
#     that. The tail part will never contain a slash; if path ends in a
#     slash, tail will be empty. If there is no slash in path, head will
#     be empty. If path is empty, both head and tail are empty. Trailing
#     slashes are stripped from head unless it is the root (one or more
#     slashes only). In all cases, join(head, tail) returns a path to the
#     same location as path (but the strings may differ). Also see the
#     functions dirname() and basename().
